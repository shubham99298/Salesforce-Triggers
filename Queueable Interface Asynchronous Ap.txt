Queueable Interface: Asynchronous Apex
1. future method:
a. It does not return any job Id. (eg. Bank transaction id)
b. You can not call one future method from another future method, job chaining is not possible
c. In future method there is specified annotation used to identify future method, but in Queuable no need to use any
specified annotation
d. You can not also query the job status in future method
e. Future method supports primitive data types but does not support objects/sobjects.
2. Queuable Interface:
b. It also runs its process in background like future method, whenever resources gets available
c. It returns the job Id thru which we can get to know the job status whether it is completed or fail
d. We can check that job id using apex jobs or by using SOQL
e.We can perfrom job chainining, it means we can call one queuable class from another queuable.
f. In Queuable it supports primitive and non primitive data types
h. Queable interface has higher limits.
